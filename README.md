PC Auto Sleep using Bluetooth

This application was created for desktop windows users.  If you have your phone or other bluetooth device on you, when you get up and leave your computer, it will automatically put the computer to sleep after a period of time that you decide.

Looking for devices will return a list of paired devices and visibile devices. Setting the Default device will set which device the application will look for to confirm that you are at your computer.

Pretty self-explanatory application.
