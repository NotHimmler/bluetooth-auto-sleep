PC Auto Sleep using Bluetooth

#Description

This application was created for desktop windows users.  If you have your phone or other bluetooth device on you, when you get up and leave your computer, it will automatically put the computer to sleep after a period of time that you decide.

I built this application to mimic the functionality that Gigabyte provides in one of their applications. However, that application doesn't work very well as it had issues with putting the PC to sleep or logging in after waking.

#Functionality

Looking for devices will return a list of paired devices and visibile devices. Setting the Default device will set which device the application will look for to confirm that you are at your computer.

#References

Bluetooth functionality is powered by 32Feet.Net library.
